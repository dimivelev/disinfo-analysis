Disinfo-Analysis-Crew


A powerful, multi-agent AI system designed to analyze web content for disinformation, bias, and emotional manipulation. This project combines a sophisticated FastAPI backend with a user-friendly Chrome extension to deliver real-time insights directly in your browser.

üåü Features

Multi-Agent AI Analysis: Utilizes a crew of specialized AI agents (powered by CrewAI) to perform a comprehensive analysis of web page content.

Real-time Insights: Get immediate feedback on the content you're reading without leaving the page.

Browser Integration: A seamless experience through a dedicated Chrome Extension.

CI/CD Pipeline: Automated build, testing, and deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions.

Scalable Backend: Built with FastAPI, ensuring high performance and scalability.

üöÄ How It Works

The system is composed of two main components: a Chrome Extension and a FastAPI backend.

Chrome Extension: The user initiates an analysis from the popup. The extension then captures the HTML of the current page.

FastAPI Backend: The HTML is sent to the backend, which parses it to extract the headline and body content.

AI Crew Analysis: The extracted text is then passed to a team of AI agents, each with a specific role:

Headline Analyzer: Checks for clickbait.

Emotional Manipulation Analyst: Detects emotionally charged language.

Bias Detection Analyst: Identifies political bias (Left, Center, Right).

Medical Detector: Scans for common conspiracy theory traits.

Results: The analysis results are streamed back to the Chrome extension and displayed to the user in a clear, easy-to-understand format.
