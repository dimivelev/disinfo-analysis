Disinformation Analysis Browser Extension


A powerful, multi-agent AI system designed to analyze web content for disinformation, bias, and emotional manipulation. This project combines a sophisticated FastAPI backend with a user-friendly Chrome extension to deliver real-time insights directly in your browser.

üåü Core Features

*   Multi-Agent AI Analysis: Employs a team of specialized AI agents (powered by CrewAI) to perform a deep and comprehensive analysis of web page content.
*   Real-time Insights: Get immediate, actionable feedback on the content you're reading without ever leaving the page.
*   Seamless Browser Integration: A smooth and intuitive user experience through a dedicated Chrome Extension.
*   Automated CI/CD Pipeline: A fully automated build, test, and deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions ensures reliability and rapid iteration.
*   Scalable & High-Performance Backend: Built with modern, high-performance web standards using FastAPI to handle requests efficiently.

üöÄ How It Works

The system is architected with two primary components: a Chrome Extension (Frontend) and a FastAPI (Backend) server.

1.  Chrome Extension: The user initiates an analysis directly from the extension's popup. The extension then captures the complete HTML of the active web page.
2.  FastAPI Backend: The captured HTML is sent to the backend, which intelligently parses it to extract the main headline and body content.
3.  AI Crew Analysis: The extracted text is then distributed to a crew of specialized AI agents, each with a distinct analytical function:
    *   Headline Analyzer: Detect if headline is clickbait.
    *   Emotional Manipulation Analyst: Identifies and quantifies the use of emotionally charged language intended to manipulate the reader.
    *   Bias Detection Analyst: Assesses the text for political bias, classifying it as Left-Leaning, Centrist, or Right-Leaning.
    *   Conspiracy Theory Detector: Scans the content for common traits and patterns found in conspiracy theories.
4.  Display of Results: The consolidated analysis is streamed back to the Chrome extension in real-time and presented to the user in a clean, easy-to-understand format.

üèÅ Getting Started

To get the project up and running locally, follow these steps.

Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+ and Pip
*   Docker Desktop
*   Google Cloud SDK (for deployment)
*   A `.env` file populated with your necessary API keys.

Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/disinfo-analysis-api.git
    cd disinfo-analysis-api
    ```

2.  **Configure the Backend**
    *   Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   Install the required dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    *   Launch the development server:
        ```bash
        uvicorn main:app --reload
        ```

3.  **Load the Chrome Extension**
    *   Open your Chrome browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
    *   Enable the **"Developer mode"** toggle in the top-right corner.
    *   Click on the **"Load unpacked"** button and select the directory containing the extension's files.
